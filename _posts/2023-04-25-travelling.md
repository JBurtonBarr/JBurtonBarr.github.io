<center><b>Langkawi 14/04/2023</b></center>

In attempts to take a break from recent PhD stress I left my laptop in Singapore and did a solo trip to Langkawi. Actually the total price for flights and accomodation only came to $160 (SGD)! I had a great time there hiking, checking out the beaches, and a few drinks along the way. I didn't go with the goals of it being a social trip, I think this took the pressure off compared to my other solo travels which really helped me relax.

<center><b>Yogyakarta 17/02/2023</b></center>
I had never flown to Indonesia before and wanted to see what it was like outside of the tourist hotspot Bali. Together with my partner we explored Yogyakarta and the surrounding areas visiting caves, beaches, cliffs, nature trails, aswell as the city itself. Really a brilliant place with great food too and definitely worth a visit if you get the chance!

<center><b>Thailand 17/06/2022</b></center>
Honestly a great trip with some friends from the UK who came to visit me in Singapore. After a few days in SG we took our backpacks, flew to Phuket, rented a car, and drove up north to Bangkok over 12 days. Between Phuket and Bangkok we visited Khlong Phanom, Surat Thani, Koh Samui, Chumphon, and Hua Hin. Delighted to say, the entire car deposit was returned to us.
