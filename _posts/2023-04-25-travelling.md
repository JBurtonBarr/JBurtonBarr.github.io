<center><b>Langkawi 14/04/2023</b></center>

In attempts to take a break from recent PhD stress I left my laptop in Singapore and did a solo trip to Langkawi. Actually the total price for flights and accomodation only came to $160 (SGD)! I had a great time there hiking, checking out the beaches, and a few drinks along the way. I didn't go with the goals of it being a social trip, I think this took the pressure off compared to my other solo travels which really helped me relax.

<center><b>Yogyakarta 17/02/2023</b></center>
I had never flown to Indonesia before and wanted to see what it was like outside of the tourist hotspot Bali. Together with my partner we explored Yogyakarta and the surrounding areas visiting caves, beaches, cliffs, nature trails, aswell as the city itself. Really a brilliant place with great food too and definitely worth a visit if you get the chance!
