<center><b>Langkawi 14/04/2023</b></center>

In attempts to take a break from recent PhD stress I left my laptop in Singapore and did a solo trip to Langkawi. Actually the total price for flights and accomodation only came to $160 (SGD)! I had a great time there hiking, checking out the beaches, and a few drinks along the way. I didn't go with the goals of it being a social trip, I think this took the pressure off compared to my other solo travels which really helped me relax.
