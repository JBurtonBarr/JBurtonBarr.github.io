<p><b>About me:</b></p>
I graduated from University of Birmingham in 2020 with a BSc in Psychology specialising in Cognitive Neuroscience. 
During the BSc I taught myself some coding skills and switched to Computer Science for my MSc. 
Focusing on AI was more inline with my goals and the work I enjoyed. 
For my PhD at Nanyang Technological University and A*STAR I chose to merge my interest in Neuroscience and AI. 
My PhD focuses on AI-on-AI control, while my work is 80% Computer Science based I still utilise my knowledge in Neuroscience for Cognitively-Inspired AI methodology.

<p><b>Research Interests:</b>
<ul>
  <li>Cognitively-Inspired AI</li>
  <li>Computer Vision</li>
  <li>AI-on-AI Control</li>
  <li>Context Recogition</li>
  <li>Hardware and Energy Efficient AI</li>
</ul></p>
